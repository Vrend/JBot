In order for you to use this project, you're going to need to make sure maven is configured

This is in order to use lavaplayer, which is a maven-based dependency

Then you need to download JDA and add it as a library dependency

Then you must make sure that the java version is set to 8, otherwise you will have a bunch of errors in the "play" class

You also need two keys to run the program

You will need to create a directory called "Keys" and put a "botapi.key" and "owneruser.key" in the folder

The botapi is where you put the bot token, so it can login

The owneruser is your user id, which is for permissions. You can get this by typing \@YOURNAME#numbers in discord
